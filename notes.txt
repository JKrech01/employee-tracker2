As the image illustrates, your schema should contain the following three tables:

department

id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY

name: VARCHAR(30) UNIQUE NOT NULL to hold department name

role

id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY

title: VARCHAR(30) UNIQUE NOT NULL to hold role title

salary: DECIMAL NOT NULL to hold role salary

department_id: INTEGER NOT NULL to hold reference to department role belongs to

employee

id: SERIAL PRIMARY KEY

first_name: VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL to hold employee first name

last_name: VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL to hold employee last name

role_id: INTEGER NOT NULL to hold reference to employee role

manager_id: INTEGER to hold reference to another employee that is the manager of the current employee (null if the employee has no manager)

You might want to use a separate file that contains functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. A constructor function or class could be helpful for organizing these. You might also want to include a seeds.sql file to pre-populate your database, making the development of individual features much easier.

Bonus
Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:

Update employee managers.

View employees by manager.

View employees by department.

Delete departments, roles, and employees.

View the total utilized budget of a departmentâ€”in other words, the combined salaries of all employees in that department.
